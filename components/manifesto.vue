              <p>We are tired of corruption, big money influencing our laws, and stupid political discourse. The system is broken. It needs a major upgrade.</p>
              <p>We believe that democracy must be honest, productive, and corruption-free.</p>
              <p>Let’s upgrade the way our laws are created. Here’s how:</p>
              <p>We believe that all citizens should be able to propose initiatives, thoughtfully discuss matters, and co-create laws. We believe that laws should be made with transparency and not behind closed doors. The actions and votes of representatives should be visible to others.</p>
              <p>We believe citizens should always have the choice of voting directly for laws or delegating their vote to others. Citizens should be able the select the representatives they want at anytime and change them immediately when they feel they no longer represent them.</p>
              <p>We believe that becoming a representative shouldn’t mean selling your soul to the political machine. It should be easy for any citizen to be able to represent others. A few or many.</p>

              <p>All of us, together, can have a massive impact on the laws that affect us.</p>

              <p>Become part of your own local revolution. The plan of action is simple, yet ambitious:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Launch or support a campaign to get enough seats in your local legislative body.</li>
                <li>Once elected, supersede the legislative body with a technology platform where initiatives can be proposed, ideas can be thoughtfully and publicly debated, votes can be cast privately, representatives can be picked and scrutinized, and decisions can be made with transparency.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Neocratia’s vision may appear utopic to many, but so too were the ideas of true democracy and universal human rights. Together, we can make Neocratia a reality. It won’t be perfect and it won’t be easy, but we must start somewhere. We must iterate, improve, and move things forward. All you have to do is send us your email address <a href="#card-join" class="v-smooth-scroll">above</a>. As soon as enough people in your area are interested, we’ll help you lead or become a member of your own local movement. Please remember that if you do nothing, you are actually perpetuating the problem — the choice is yours.</p>

          <v-card>
            <v-card-text class="grey lighten-4">
              <p>Neocratia started when a bunch of us got together and asked ourselves:</p>
              <p>
                  <strong>“If democracy were invented today, what would it be like?”</strong>
              </p>
              <p>We sought the advice of thought leaders in several sectors. We invested time in researching the origins of democracy itself and were particularly inspired by the French political philosopher, Alexis de Tocqueville (1805–1859).</p>
              <p>
                In 1835, Tocqueville travelled to the youngest democracy in the world and collated his conclusions in a book called “Democracy in America”. Tocqueville believed that democracy has a tendency to degenerate into 'soft despotism', where a country is overrun by “a network of small complicated rules” that degrade the democratic processes. Thus, while people are under the illusion that they are in control, they can actually exercise very little influence over their government.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tocqueville predicted that the American democracy was constructed in such a way that it would inevitably spiral into a society awash with individualists who would do little more than contribute to a burgeoning bureaucracy. People would surrender their common and communal responsibility to government, forgetting their own interests. A society would remain that was dominated by individualism in which bureaucracy ruled and the government was both aloof and distant.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sound familiar, right? We firmly believe that Tocqueville described what is happening all over the world. Our politicians are disconnected, bureaucracy rules, and citizens have lost their connection to the origins of democracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We conducted hundreds of brainstorm sessions on the topic. While we found many aspects and instances where democracy would be similar to what it is today, we also found many others where it would be both very different — and better. One of them, in particular, could have a major impact on the way democracies work: <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf" target="_blank">the process of creating laws</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Simultaneously, we started coding nights and weekends developing the software required to prototype some of the best ideas.
              </p>
              <p>
                After two years of researching and experimenting, we identified the most promising ideas and combined them in this manifesto:
              </p>
                  <strong>
                  We call it Neocratia and our mission is to upgrade the way our laws are created and societies govern themselves.
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                 We at Neocratia are activists who remain committed to improving democracy. Like casting a pebble into a pond, we believe that in time, the ripple we start will reach the furthest shore.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Today more than ever, ordinary citizens need to get involved; they need to stand up and be counted; they need to rally for change in the mechanics of government.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Neocratia can succeed in many ways: it can enable the creation and improvement of thousands of democracies, big and small, become the legislative branch of existing democracies, make democracy part of our daily lives, enable introverts to become political leaders, and more. We expect, at least, to inspire others to improve the government of the people, by the people, for the people.

            <v-card-text class="grey lighten-4">
              <p>Citizens eligible to vote within any Neocratic jurisdiction may choose representatives using an electronic platform. When citizens don’t vote for a law proposal directly, representatives vote on their behalf. Representatives, in turn, can delegate their vote, and those delegated to them, to other representatives. When choosing two or more representatives, the vote delegation will be split into equal parts. Thus, if a citizen chooses four representatives, each representative will be able to vote (or delegate) 25% of the citizen’s vote.</p>

              <p name="a765" id="a765" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Representatives have a voting weight. This is the sum of all votes delegated to a representative plus the representative’s own vote. Representatives may also choose their own representatives and delegate all their voting weight.</p>
              <p name="20ec" id="20ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a Neocratic community, all citizens may allow others to choose them as representatives. The only requirements are their agreeing to making all votes transparent and visible to others and volunteering their work. Similarly to how volunteers have created Wikipedia and made it broader, fairer, and more accurate than previous encyclopedias created by paid editors, we believe that many volunteer representatives will perform a better job than a few paid, income-dependent politicians.</p>
              <p name="8aef" id="8aef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Neocratia citizens are able to choose the representatives they want at any time and change them should they no longer feel duly represented.</p>

              Representatives in Neocratic communities have public profiles on an electronic platform.

(We'll gladly advise.) Neocratium will allow communities of any size and type — even non-political ones — to manage their democracies. Once Neocratium is ready, groups can create communities using the hosted version, or download the source code and install their own on a server.</p>
              <p name="ae80" id="ae80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When a community uses Neocratium, the settings of the platform will be managed by a team of administrators. The platform administrators will be appointed by the executive branch of the government of each community (following procedures similar to current democratic convention). Each citizen will have an account provided and/or approved by the administrators. Neocratic communities must provide their citizens with the means to access the electronic platform, including devices and connectivity. Neocratium will offer single sign-on integration with existing electronic IDs already offered by numerous governments.</p>
